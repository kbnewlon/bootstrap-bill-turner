# responsiveness-portfolio

The purpose of this application is to introduce my use of responsive design as well as create the first layer of my portfolio. I have created four pages; landing, about me, contact, and a place to eventually showcase my work. I have attached screenshots of my site below.

![contact] (/assets\ContactMeScreenShot.PNG)

As you'll be able to see in this functional, web application, each page has a consistent nav bar and all links work. I also utilized Bootstrap components and a grid system. My code used semantic html and has been validated by the W3C Markup Validation Service.
