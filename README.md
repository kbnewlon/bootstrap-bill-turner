# portfolio

The purpose of this application is to introduce my use of responsive design as well as create the first layers of my portfolio. I have created four pages; landing, about me, contact, and a place to showcase my work. I have attached screenshots of my site below. 

On this functional web application, each page has a consistent nav bar with working links. I also utilized Bootstrap components and a grid system. My code used semantic html and has been validated by the W3C Markup Validation Service.
